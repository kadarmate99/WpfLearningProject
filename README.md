# WpfLearningProject: WiredBrainCoffee.CustomersApp

This repository contains code created while following the **WPF 6 Fundamentals** course on Pluralsight by [Thomas Claudius Huber](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/thomas-huber).

## About the App

A simple customer management application built with WPF following MVVM pattern. Features include adding, editing, and deleting customers, plus a moveable navigation panel and basic product management. The application allows switching between customers and products views within a single window through the MVVM architecture and view model switching.

## What I Learned and Practiced

- **MVVM Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with ViewModels, data binding, and command pattern using custom DelegateCommand implementation
- **Data Binding**: Two-way binding, observable collections, value converters, and input validation with INotifyDataErrorInfo
- **WPF Controls**: Custom UserControls, XAML styling with resource dictionaries, control templates, and data templates
- **Dependency Injection**: Using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for loose coupling and testability
- **XAML**: Grid layouts, triggers, merged resource dictionaries, and responsive design patterns
